# WordNetDomainsFilter

The alignments in this repository are used for an experimental evaluation of the WordNet Domains filter approach in two datasets:
1. Bibframe versus Schema.org
2. DBPedia versus Sumo

The Alignments.zip contains the following alignments:
* The manually produced reference alignments
* The original alignments produced by running the string matching algorithm ISub
* The filtered alignments produced by our WordNet Domains filtering approach.
